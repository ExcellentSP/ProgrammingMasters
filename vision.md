# Programming Masters Vision
This Discord server rose out of the popularity of the following post: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dq9isz/i_want_to_teach_someone_programming/

If you are part of this server, you are programming journeymen or higher who have or want an apprentice and would like to collaborate with other professionals. We're each here to direct potential apprentices to better suited professionals for their goals, pool our teaching resources, express difficulties, and solve problems.

The users of r/learnprogramming have given us the gift of their drive and devotion. They are allowing us to teach and mold them into great programmers so they can accomplish their dreams. Let’s not fail them.

In the spirit of this modified apprenticeship style, we will abide by the following practices:
1. We can’t tell you how to run your apprenticeships, but we can exclude you from the group if you do not follow the guidelines laid out by the official visionaries.
2. A list of the current official visionaries are as follows:
   - Shane Phillips (ExcellentSP)
3. Take on only as many students to which you can devote at least 1 hour per week.
4. If you’re getting paid from a project your apprentice assisted in building, you must coordinate compensation with your apprentice. All forms of compensation is up to you, but you must be able to justify your ethics.
5. Apprentices will not pay for apprenticeship or lessons with a few exceptions. Exceptions must be clarified with official visionaries of this group. 
6. Your position as a mentor is to assist your apprentice in accomplishing their goals. Many times their goals are misdirected due to inexperience. Ensure they are clear about what they need to accomplish and have them work towards that.
7. Due to the nature of this method, you may find a lack of commitment in many apprentices. It is your responsibility to vet their experience, drive, and commitment. Choose wisely.
8. Your choice in apprentices is purely up to you. So it the continuance of their education with you. If for any reason you can no longer mentor an apprentice when they would like to continue, ensure you recommend them to another mentor who might be able take them on.

We are still in the concept phases of this idea so everything and anything about this collaboration is subject to change.
